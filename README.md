# The Odin Project Rock Paper Scissor
Foundation Course Project Rock Paper Scissor

### Assignment
Create a Rock, Paper, and Scissor game.

### Project Goal
Use what I've learnt so far about HTML, CSS, and Javascript from The Odin Project to create a simple Rock, Paper, and Scissor game.
Ideally, I want to create a dynamic UI that is both visually good looking and functional.
